# Express.js Project Setup

During the research of the Express.js ecosystem, I focused on two critical areas for our next project: the admin panel implementation and handling of media files. I considered various solutions, looking for the ones that provide robust functionality, flexibility, and strong community support.

## 1) Admin Panel Implementation

For the admin panel, I considered **AdminJS** (via @adminjs/express) and **Forest Express** (via forest-express).

### AdminJS

AdminJS provides an automatically generated and customizable admin interface, which works seamlessly with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

**Pros:**

- Highly customizable to fit the project needs
- Built-in TypeScript declarations, easing development
- Solid community backing with 15k+ weekly npm downloads

**Cons:**

- Might be too feature-rich for simpler applications
- The default UI might require customization for certain aesthetics

### Forest Express

Forest Express shines in handling complex data structures and relationships with an appealing UI.

**Pros:**

- Excellent for complex data management
- Regular updates (last update was just 3 days ago)

**Cons:**

- No built-in TypeScript declarations
- Slightly less community support (around 6k weekly npm downloads)

My choice would be **AdminJS** due to its flexibility, TypeScript support, and stronger community acceptance.

## 2) Media Files Handling

To handle media files, I weighed the pros and cons of **Multer with Sharp** and **Cloudinary**.

### Multer with Sharp

Multer handles multipart/form-data, primarily for file uploads, while Sharp offers efficient image processing.

**Pros:**

- High configurability and efficiency
- Strong community backing

**Cons:**

- No built-in support for cloud storage
- Limited to image processing

### Cloudinary

Cloudinary is a comprehensive cloud service for media management.

**Pros:**

- All-in-one solution for media handling
- Supports various media types and manipulations

**Cons:**

- Paid service beyond the free tier
- Could be overkill for simpler media handling needs

Considering the trade-offs, I would go with **Multer with Sharp** for projects with basic media handling needs due to their efficiency and versatility.

## Additional Packages

To the given list of packages (`bcryptjs`, `dotenv`, `express-validator`, `jsonwebtoken`, `mongoose`, `swagger-jsdoc`, `swagger-ui-express`, `eslint`, `nodemon`, `prettier`), here's a brief description of each package and why it would be beneficial for our project:

- **dotenv:** Manages environment variables, increasing project security and configurability.
- **nodemon:** Enhances development productivity by automatically restarting the server after any file changes.
- **bcryptjs:** Secures user data by hashing and comparing passwords.
- **express-validator:** Provides middleware for validating and sanitizing input data, increasing API reliability.
- **jsonwebtoken:** Manages user authentication and secure data exchange via tokens.
- **eslint:** Ensures code quality and consistency with predefined rules.
- **prettier:** Automates and enforces a consistent code formatting style.

Each package contributes to the robustness and maintainability of the project, and their combined use results in a solid foundation for any Express.js application.
